# AutoScale-Load-Balancer-with-Route-53-Project
In this project, we will learn how to create and configure all the AWS resources required to automatically scale an application in response to traffic/load. We will also configure Route 53 to route traffic to the load balancer using a custom domain.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Create a Launch Template for EC2 instances.

* Set up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to manage EC2 instances based on demand.

* Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic.

* Integrate Amazon Route 53 with the ALB using a custom domain name.

* Ensure high availability and fault tolerance of the application.


## ✅ Prerequisites
You should be familiar with:

EC2 Basics – including launching instances and connecting to them using SSH

Working with the AWS Console

Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Launch Templates

CloudWatch – understanding metrics and alarms

EC2 Security Groups – managing firewall rules

Route 53 – understanding domain registration, hosted zones, and routing traffic using record sets
